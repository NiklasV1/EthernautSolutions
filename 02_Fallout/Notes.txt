The goal of this level is gaining ownership of the target contract.

The contract contains a function called Fal1out() that is intended to be the constructor.

However, it is a public function instead as constructors are written with the following syntax:

    constructor() {}

Additionally, it contains a typo in the word Fallout.

Since this function provides the caller with ownership of the contract we can use it to exploit the contract.

Plan of Attack:
    - call the Fal1out() function
    -> This is enough to gain ownership
