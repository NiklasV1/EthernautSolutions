Repository for my solutions for each Ethernaut level.

I have not uploaded all of my solutions yet, and i plan on writing small writeups
for each level in the form of a Notes.txt file.

Most of the solutions were written using remix.ethereum.org

All solutions were tested on the Sepolia testnet to complete the corresponding level.

Some levels do not require an attack contract to exploit and therefore dont have a Attack.sol file.
