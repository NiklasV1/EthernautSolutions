In this level, the target contract has a flip(bool) function that lets the caller predict a "random" coinflip.

The goal of the level is predicting the coinflip 10 times in a row.

Since the function flip(bool) uses a hash of the previous block number for its randomness, it is not truly random.

As we also know the previous block number we can calculate the result of the coin flip before calling the target contract.

Since the target only allows one call of the flip(bool) function per block we repeat this process 10 times.

To automate the prediction process we implement the Attack contract that has a function to automatically predict one coinflip.

Plan of Attack:
    - Calculate the result of the coin flip
    - Call the target with the calculated result as a prediction
    - Repeat the previous steps 10 times on different blocks
    -> This allows us to predict the coinflip 10 times in a row
